<summary>generate  change  list  separated  types  using  labels</summary>
<description>discussed the mailing list instead one big list improvements the change list for the release divided into change types based labels required specify which labels should considered separately some other labels can excluded like question refactoring new release notes builder factory project show separately changes with label mappings enhancement improvements bug fixed bugs doc documentation ignore changes with labels refactoring invalid question wontfix duplicate there also header for other changes method override default other header changed internally improvement change better give meaning change but done separate commit can easily reverted amended you don like have better name sample changelog generated for current release number issues the same with the old mechanism many them are placed other section don have labels assigned changes improvements improved the javadoc example custom answer implementation avoided classloader issue when testing eclipse plugins environment removed java files from main mockito jar artifacts smarter constructor injection choosing biggest constructor instead the default one deep stub style mocks can serialized fixed the behavior compare method the mock objects new mocking details get invocations method for inspecting what happened with the mock mock serialization deserialization across classloader jvm improved mockito test listener making reset argument captors before each test improve interactions wanted report include the name the mock new get argument method for convenient implementation custom answers fixed bugs allow calling real implementation jdk extension methods documentation other fixed wrong javadoc for additional answers added useful links readme deprecated timeout never line with timeout most verification with timout measures time more more accurately new then method for bdd style interaction testing enabled continuous integration with travis and coverage tracking with coveralls coveralls coverage tracking tool allows mockito source code preview improved behavior equals with delta with regards null handling have take look why some labelled issues were ommited both mechanisms what you think about that szpak force pushed the szpak forks topic release labels branch from 40d 47a 7016 sep 2014 copy link coveralls commented sep 2014 changes unknown when pulling 47a 7016 szpak topic release labels into mockito master copy link member author szpak commented sep 2014 btw was created and wasn test driven once was converted into separate project plugin would useful have better tests copy link ghost commented sep 2014 hey this very cool haven looked the code yet but looking nice thanks wed sep 2014 marcin zaj Ä…czkowski notifications github com wrote btw was created and wasn test driven once was converted into separate project plugin would useful have better tests reply this email directly view git hub comment szczepan faber core dev gradle founder mockito copy link member mockitoguy commented sep 2014 hey was about merge this but one thing picked interest documentation this not quite true there were many improvements the documentation but they weren correctly managed via the ticketing system the result looks like haven touched the docs years marcin can you update that the label not shown contains items changed internally improvement change better give meaning change but done separate commit can easily reverted amended you don like have better name see that you introduced top level changes element the view makes sense model the change too not too fuzzed about but like the release notes not contain any changes basically believe that changes are not important they are means achieve things like improving stuff they are like implementation details rather the view and the model something like improvements new features enahancements fixed bugs documentation other this not something have deal now just wanted share view and maybe get your feedback have take look why some labelled issues were ommited both mechanisms order for the issue presented has hash the commit message the commit notes like closed github issue tracker status closed the commit within correct range between previous and this release head unless there some bug szpak force pushed the szpak forks topic release labels branch from 47a 7016 938d sep 2014 szpak added commits sep 2014 release notes changelog release notes separated assigned 5bda 39e labels release notes add support for custom header for other improvements 36414 release notes minor improvements 6edd better support for nested sub lists markdown fix incompatibility with java remove displaying category with changes enhance displaying list with changes all support for new feature label szpak force pushed the szpak forks topic release labels branch from 938d 6edd sep 2014 copy link coveralls commented sep 2014 changes unknown when pulling 6edd szpak topic release labels into mockito master copy link member author szpak commented sep 2014 reworked changes and adjusted model that with improvements the top also removed displaying categories with improvements improvements enhancements improved the javadoc example custom answer implementation avoided classloader issue when testing eclipse plugins environment removed java files from main mockito jar artifacts smarter constructor injection choosing biggest constructor instead the default one improve exception messages when user mocks method declared non public parent deep stub style mocks can serialized fixed the behavior compare method the mock objects new mocking details get invocations method for inspecting what happened with the mock mock serialization deserialization across classloader jvm improved mockito test listener making reset argument captors before each test improve interactions wanted report include the name the mock new get argument method for convenient implementation custom answers new lightweight stub only mocks for scenarios where high performance needed fixed bugs ensure continuous deployment process does not produce dev versions fix flaky test timeout test allow calling real implementation jdk extension methods fixed delegating method equals that easier extend mockito custom verification modes other fixed wrong javadoc for additional answers added useful links readme deprecated timeout never line with timeout most verification with timout measures time more more accurately new then method for bdd style interaction testing enabled continuous integration with travis and coverage tracking with coveralls coveralls coverage tracking tool allows mockito source code preview improved behavior equals with delta with regards null handling btw currently there label with space the project has tested there will not problem with new feature copy link member mockitoguy commented sep 2014 this really really nice try merge this soon copy link member mockitoguy commented oct 2014 will merge soon mockitoguy added commit that referenced this pull request nov 2014 release notes changelog release notes separated assigned 976d labels mockitoguy added commit that referenced this pull request nov 2014 release notes add support for custom header for other improvements 8fc 8761 mockitoguy added commit that referenced this pull request nov 2014 release notes minor improvements dbb 67fd better support for nested sub lists markdown fix incompatibility with java remove displaying category with changes enhance displaying list with changes all support for new feature label bric added the continuous integration label jun 2015 copy link contributor timvd lippe commented may 2016 seems that some the changes landed master but not all could you give update szczepiq what still required updated and merged copy link contributor timvd lippe commented jun 2016 szpak you maybe know what the status this pull request can seem determine which changes have landed and which haven copy link member author szpak commented jun 2016 edited timvd lippe afair szczepiq merged commits but later reverted removed them due some refactoring was doing the release notes mechanism looking the reports separation per label not used currently see others generated only for two dates copy link contributor timvd lippe commented jun 2016 szpak all right thanks for the explanation are you willing update this accordingly these changes are once again incorporated copy link member author szpak commented jun 2016 may take look how does look the current context but unfortunately rather not within the incoming weeks feel free take this topic you would like have earlier timvd lippe mentioned this pull request jul 2016 improve release generator 478 closed copy link contributor timvd lippe commented jul 2016 extracted 478 for now therefore closing this pull request timvd lippe closed this jul 2016 sign for free join this conversation git hub already have account sign comment reviewers

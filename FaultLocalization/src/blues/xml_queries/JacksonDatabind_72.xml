<description>edited minimal repro public class something public inner something json creator public something json property inner something class inner something json creator public inner something object mapper mapper new object mapper string ser mapper write value string new something null mapper read value ser something class fails like this java lang array index out bounds exception com fasterxml jackson databind deser impl property value buffer assign parameter property value buffer java 210 com fasterxml jackson databind deser bean deserializer deserialize using property based bean deserializer java 380 com fasterxml jackson databind deser bean deserializer base deserialize from object using non default bean deserializer base java 1123 com fasterxml jackson databind deser bean deserializer deserialize from object bean deserializer java 298 com fasterxml jackson databind deser bean deserializer deserialize bean deserializer java 133 com fasterxml jackson databind object mapper read map and close object mapper java 3807 com fasterxml jackson databind object mapper read value object mapper java 2797 validation missing for this impossible constructor works expected when inner something static the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered khogeland mentioned this issue jan 2017 stack overflow error deserialization 1502 closed copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2017 definitely feels like this related 1502 too errors seem vary slightly based minor differences copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2017 interesting fails branches but master cowtowncoder added this the milestone jan 2017 copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2017 and the reason for failure was that not delegating various methods from inner class property underlying creator property something that was actually fixed for master creating delegating base class for such properties suspect this will resolve 1502 and 1503 but will check them separately cowtowncoder closed this 63afa jan 2017 copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2017 one additional note actual test case will not actually pass due complications trying pass inner class creator parameter would however work regular property this may may not fixable but least exception message more descriptive sign for free join this conversation git hub already have account sign comment assignees one assigned labels none yet projects none yet milestone linked pull requests successfully merging pull request may close this issue none yet participants</description>

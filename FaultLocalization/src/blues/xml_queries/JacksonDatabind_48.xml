<summary>should  respect mapper feature  auto  detect  getters  setters</summary>
<description>when set the object mapper mapper config not auto detect and use the basic class introspector get the properties seem still getting the methods currently using version the following code produces this output found property count there should only one found property name name internal name name found property name groupname internal name groupname think should produce only this output found property name groupname internal name groupname public static void main string args class cls json property groupname private string groupname public void set name string str this groupname str public string get name return groupname object mapper new object mapper only use explicitly specified values serialized deserialized json property configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature auto detect fields false configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature auto detect getters false configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature auto detect setters false configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature auto detect getters false configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature use getters setters false configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature can override access modifiers true configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature infer property mutators false configure com fasterxml jackson databind mapper feature use annotations true java type java type get type factory construct type cls class basic class introspector introspector new basic class introspector basic bean description bdesc introspector for serialization get serialization config java type null list bean property definition bprops bdesc find properties bprops size system out println found property count bprops size there should only one bprops for each prop system out println found property name prop get name internal name prop get internal name the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered copy link member cowtowncoder commented may 2016 headw with quick look that looks like flaw you disable auto detection only groupname should found more common way nowadays set visibility levels low enough visibility none but method you show should still also work copy link member cowtowncoder commented may 2016 actually you try serialization only one property serialized think this has more with introspection mechanism you are using not quite how jackson itself detects properties check out this bit more and code sample how introspection would work copy link member cowtowncoder commented may 2016 actually take that back access just fine but does look like there minor flaw handling due earlier optimizations auto detection settings are only considered for relevant parts and setter visibility not considered relevant for serialization long story short this leads set name being considered visible which adds name property later property collector will remove not being used and this why issues have been reported but the removal should really occur earlier think have fix make here just need think carefully whether fix safe add for just cowtowncoder changed the title should basic class introspector for serialization find properties respect mapper feature auto detect getters setters basic class introspector for serialization find properties should respect mapper feature auto detect getters setters may 2016 cowtowncoder changed the title basic class introspector for serialization find properties should respect mapper feature auto detect getters setters basic class introspector for serialization find properties should respect mapper feature auto detect getters setters may 2016 cowtowncoder added this the milestone may 2016 cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this issue may 2016 add test for 1223 68f cowtowncoder closed this 32b may 2016 athirupathisc mentioned this issue aug 2017 jackson behavior change involving auto detect getters from 1739 closed sign for free join this conversation git hub already have account sign comment assignees one assigned labels none yet projects none yet milestone linked pull requests successfully merging pull request may close this issue none yet participants</description>

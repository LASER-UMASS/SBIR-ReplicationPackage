<summary>failing  tests  windows  machine</summary>
<description>just posted the google forums but someway somehow post immediately disappeared the void reposting again here have failing tests windows machine default mocking details test should get extra interfaces unit dependencies test pure mockito should not depend unit byte buddy class loaders test excluding class loader cannot load classes when correct source url set for the first test was able let pass changing line https github com mockito mockito blob master test org mockito internal util default mocking details test java bar bar mock bar class with settings extra interfaces list class observer class not sure this indeed the correct test please let know for the 2nd test first get the stack trace java lang assertion error org mockito configuration mockito configuration has some

class loader java 357 more the reason changed that line because the temp result does not contain dots windows machines due the fact that absolutepath does not return path seperated but however then the test fails because the times test test does indeed depend junit shouldn only load classes that are under src the 3rd test sadly have clue why succeeding and not throwing exception looking forward your responses the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered copy link contributor alberskib commented jun 2015 second test should fixed 206 checkout and check copy link contributor author timvd lippe commented jun 2015 another note when run the test suite with coverage using ecl emma all tests fields test fail the tests fields should return all declared fields hierarchy can filter not null fields and fields should return declared fields fail because the element jacoco data the array the other tests can get list instance field java lang assertion error

oops forgot mention that tested 206 and did not fix the issue the stacktrace get with that fix the same 2nd stacktrace posted copy link contributor alberskib commented jun 2015 jeremybell could you check your first post looks like that for the 2nd test both cases before and after change stacktraces are the same what the difference edit noticed different class name copy link contributor author timvd lippe commented jun 2015 see that the first test has been fixed now master per 407574 clue why upstream didn pull these changes copy link contributor alberskib commented jun 2015 jeremybell machine with windows not able reproduce problems described you there anything special your config are you running tests master branch copy link contributor author timvd lippe commented jun 2015 yes running master with changes running jdk that matters copy link member raphw commented jun 2015 guess that the test errors are ide related seems about class loader scoping can successfully run the tests windows and windows copy link contributor author timvd lippe commented jun 2015 and you are using intelli suppose will switch over intelli this summer after that happened will let know copy link member raphw commented jun 2015 using intelli tried both with the ide and gradle eclipse built top and there some strange class loader stuff that comes with looked into eclipse make the byte buddy tests work which often test class loaders depended instrumentations not that trivial write tests for this and this why assume the tests fail copy link contributor author timvd lippe commented aug 2015 closing this issue now running linux intelli seems too much work for marginal result timvd lippe closed this aug 2015 timvd lippe mentioned this issue may 2016 mockito cannot mock this class interface

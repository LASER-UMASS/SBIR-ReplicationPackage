<summary>regress  handling  deprecated  too  minimalistic</summary>
<description>note spun from https github com faster xml jackson issues due changes type resolution most direct construction methods java type sub classes can not fully supported failure modes are typically with complex cases and expected rare with one exception use simple type construct class because this mostly used for complex types and not just well known interfaces like list map actual access least immediate fields necessary and similarly lack super type info problematic and its usage likely wide spread despite existence preferable methods type factory since refactoring type resolution was not anticipated early enough advance deprecation methods want move users away from could not done should have been perfect case exact reasoning behind problems quite complicated but the fundamental reason that type factory has all the logic the generic resolution java type has and should have very little any since reference the factory passed via constructors factory methods they can not properly delegate resolution tasks this why direct calls should only made with all necessary pre resolved information passing java types for elements not class inability resolve things means that super types can not properly resolved for example handling fields methods will also inexact wrt generic types the first immediate problem something that should addressable introspection pojo deserializer builder does not find any fields methods should possible least find them even type resolution for generic types will not work well this should acceptable for the common and reported case constructing element types for collections and maps generic parameterization will not accessible anyway there are other potential issues address best can but first things first the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered cowtowncoder mentioned this issue jan 2016 regression when moving from faster xml jackson closed cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this issue jan 2016 add failing test for 1102 loading status checks 5dc 929 cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this issue jan 2016 partial fix for 1102 use simple type itself works some degree loading status checks 85620 cowtowncoder closed this 21a jan 2016 cowtowncoder added this the milestone jan 2016 copy link member author cowtowncoder commented jan 2016 was able reproduce issue reported added bit more testing for map case stand alone pojo sub classing usage direct methods should now work for common usage familiar with tkruse you have easy way test would appreciate your verification here master jackson databind has version with which your code should work with would really like solve this well for this one significant backwards compatibility issues reported and resolved copy link tkruse commented jan 2016 for was quicker set repo that reproduces the problem https github com tkruse jacksonbug you can get the test pass with the new version that would great copy link member author cowtowncoder commented jan 2016 tkruse yes passes with locally built snapshot was interested learning whether you might have bigger system which there might other usages but this isolated test passes fine sign for free join this conversation git hub already have account sign comment assignees one assigned labels none yet projects none yet milestone linked pull requests successfully merging pull request may close this issue none yet participants</description>

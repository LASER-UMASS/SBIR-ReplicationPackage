<summary>block  more  jdk  types  from  polymorphic  deserialization  cve  2017  15095</summary>
<description>note follow for 1599 after initial set types blocked new reports have arrived for more black listing although eventual approach likely rely separate module for more timely updates and wider version coverage this point addition databind needed will update specific list additions once complete and release out target versions are and possible backport and even but there diminishing return effort with those versions will not happen unless specifically requested happy merge the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered cowtowncoder added this the milestone

depends jackson databind supports jdk for little while longer created 1857 apply ddfddfb would really great that could included future release thanks cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this

some cost maintain older versions but probably for simple blacklist additions thank you for your help with backport cowtowncoder added the cve label dec 2017 cowtowncoder changed the title block more jdk types from polymorphic deserialization block more jdk types from polymorphic deserialization cve 2017 15095 dec 2017 this was referenced jan 2018 update com fasterxml jackson version logstash

version mentioned that possible backport well would really nice have this for actually are using version move then gives lot dependency change scala module copy link member author cowtowncoder commented jan 2018 poverma volunteer based oss project not have resources maintain large number backported versions and since there revenue even counter productive more that they are supported more users postpone upgrades this point unlikely that version will get more fixes least for polymorphic deserialization problem that only affects certain group users and not general security issue copy link poverma commented feb 2018 thanks cowtowncoder have tried with jackson databind version for that have upgrade scala minor version but there dependency issue what changed jackson group com fasterxml jackson core name jackson core version group com fasterxml jackson core name jackson annotations version group com fasterxml jackson jaxrs name jackson jaxrs json provider version group com

went wrong execution failed for task apps release dependencies could not resolve all dependencies for configuration apps release resolve conflict was found between the following modules org scala lang scala reflect org scala lang scala reflect copy link member author cowtowncoder commented feb 2018 problems with scala version compatibility are unrelated but you might want upgrade instead the first step conflict itself that something your build system gradle would have help with cowtowncoder mentioned this issue feb 2018 block two more gadgets exploit default typing issue cve 2018 7489 1931

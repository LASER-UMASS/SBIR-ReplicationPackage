<description>edited cowtowncoder have send email info fasterxml com the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered ayound closed this apr 2017 ayound reopened this apr 2017 ayound changed the title jackson deserializer vulnerability can execute any code command jackson deserializer security vulnerability apr 2017 copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 have received this and investigating possible patch problem quite specific but some aspects are more general cowtowncoder added active labels apr 2017 cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this issue apr 2017 fix 1599 for loading status checks 60d 459c merge branch into cowtowncoder added this the milestone apr 2017 copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 edited fixed and master the best knowledge will and well cowtowncoder closed this 6ce 32ff apr 2017 copy link viyond commented apr 2017 nice copy link author ayound commented apr 2017 when you want release and similar comment copy link joy chou commented apr 2017 when you want release and copy link one source cat commented apr 2017 edited don think blacklist good mechanism prevent this issue because there are other java deserialized gadgets class loaders can arise this problem including com sun org apache xalan which your list copy link author ayound commented apr 2017 suggest you use black list like this bsh com google inject com mchange com sun jndi com sun corba com sun javafx com sun org apache regex internal java awt java rmi javax management javax naming javax script javax swing org apache commons beanutils org apache commons collections functors org apache myfaces org apache wicket org apache xalan org codehaus groovy runtime org hibernate org python org springframework sun rmi javax imageio java util service loader java net url class loader copy link channingwen commented apr 2017 hello everybody wait for new version where can get the version release and copy link ipaddicting commented apr 2017 cowtowncoder when will released can find mvn repo git release copy link taisenki commented apr 2017 when will released wait for new version copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 maluguos not release new version for every single bug fix have look release schedule https github com faster xml jackson wiki jackson release new version unlikely released within next couple weeks same goes for new version needed sooner you will need use local snapshot build copy link kuaike commented apr 2017 waiting for version release copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 ayound appreciate the list but honest think that restriction within core databind need focused demonstratable security concerns there are many types that could potentially problematic but would hesitate include very wide limits say org springframework since there are utility types that may well already use some users for did include few types per https github com kantega notsoserial not against extending the list but this point prefer keeping static blacklist minimum copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 edited everyone did mvn deploy for branches snapshots via sonatype snapshot repository for snapshot should have initial protection for vulnerabilities indicated perhaps more importantly just pushed micro patch jackson databind should available soon via maven central decided this because not clear whether there will more full releases and when and due criticality this fix seemed better release micro patch this point set fixes rather short still https github com faster xml jackson wiki jackson release think whether should similarly release full release may take time although there will certainly still not yet released anyone feels urgency wrt please let know copy link logan 2013 commented apr 2017 everyone any impact version thank you advanced copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 logan 2013 yes and only object model using either default typing json type info with nominal base type java lang object one small number tag tag types like java serializable and perhaps java util comparable json content comes from untrusted source that someone can craft specific json message there least one reproduction issue now versions prior have plan implement new jackson module which can used with all versions including this may take bit more time but would more useful than handling within jackson databind hope this helps copy link alexchenfeiyu commented apr 2017 cowtowncoder hello our product used need solve the problem urgently how can hope your help thank you advance copy link ycrxun commented apr 2017 everyone any impact version thank you advanced copy link paulwong 888 commented apr 2017 edited cowtowncoder any impact jackson jdk and above copy link member cowtowncoder commented apr 2017 alexchenfeiyu you know the vulnerability and that affects you appreciate your general concern but the vulnerability quite specific and does not apply majority users anyway will ahead now and release will available within couple hours ycrxun theory yes versions and above paulwong 888 per above not very specific jackson version but you may want use jackson databind since the first one have the fix however possible jdk version matters might not work later jdk versions but don have specific knowledge that would prevent particular version using latest jdk from given line could safer depends embedded version xsl engine jdk bundles vulnerability this only applies polymorphic type handling via default typing especially annotated json type info java lang object type property and obviously json crafted untrusted third party copy link shellb commented apr 2017 cowtowncoder did not find the url please provide this url thank you 169 hidden items load more this

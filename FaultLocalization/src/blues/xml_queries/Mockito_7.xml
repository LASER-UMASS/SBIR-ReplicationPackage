<summary>deep  stubbing  with  generic  responses  the  call  chain  not  working</summary>
<description>deep stubbing will throw exception multiple generics occur the call chain for instance consider having mock mock that provides function that returns generic also has function that returns generic exception with the message raw extraction not supported for null will thrown example the following test will throw exception public class mockito generics deep stub test test public void discover deep mocking generics class mock mock class class returns deep stubs when mock get nested get nested return something then return hello world public static interface class extends class public get nested public static interface class extends class public get nested public static interface class public string return something you can make this test run you step into the class returns deep stubs and change the method with settings using return mock settings with returns deep stubs instead returns deep stubs serialization fallback default answer private mock settings with settings using generic metadata support return type generic metadata mock creation settings parent mock settings mock settings mock settings return type generic metadata has raw extra interfaces with settings extra interfaces return type generic metadata raw extra interfaces with settings return propagate serialization settings mock settings parent mock settings default answer this however this breaks other tests and features think the issue that further generics are not possible mocked returns deep stubs serialization fallback since the generic metadata support closed this point thanks and kind regards tobias the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered pbielicki pushed commit pbielicki mockito that referenced this issue dec 2014 fix proposal for issue mockito 128 6668b bric mentioned this issue dec 2014 fix 128 deep stubbing with generic responses the call chain not working 142 merged pbielicki pushed commit pbielicki mockito that referenced this issue dec 2014 fix proposal for issue mockito 128 424df bric feedback taken into account mockitoguy closed this 3ca 1ba dec 2014 mockitoguy added the bug label dec 2014 bric added commit bric mockito that referenced this issue jun 2015 rework stubbing api should fix mockito 128 9fafc added duplicate method avoid null warning vararg when single value passed added suppress warning limit warning effects generic vararg heap pollution for jdk users bric added commit bric mockito that referenced this issue jun 2015 rework stubbing api should fix mockito 128 272f added duplicate method avoid null warning vararg when single value passed added suppress warning limit warning effects generic vararg heap pollution for jdk users bric added commit bric mockito that referenced this issue jun 2015 rework stubbing api should fix mockito 128 loading status checks 227b 867 added duplicate method avoid null warning vararg when single value passed added suppress warning limit warning effects generic vararg heap pollution for jdk users bric added commit bric mockito that referenced this issue jul 2015 rework stubbing api should fix mockito 128 loading status checks added duplicate method avoid null warning vararg when single value passed added suppress warning limit warning effects generic vararg heap pollution for jdk users bric added commit bric mockito that referenced this issue jul 2015 rework stubbing api should fix mockito 128 72ef 104 added duplicate method avoid null warning vararg when single value passed added suppress warning limit warning effects generic vararg heap pollution for jdk users bric added commit bric mockito that referenced this issue jul 2015 rework stubbing api should fix mockito 128 6df 356e added duplicate method avoid null warning vararg when single value passed added suppress warning limit warning effects generic vararg heap pollution for jdk users sign for free join this conversation git hub already have account sign comment assignees one assigned labels bug projects none yet milestone milestone linked pull requests successfully merging pull request may close this issue none yet participants</description>

cowtowncoder commented jan 2016 that does seem wrong would possible have minimalistic test case assume much this could removed while still reproduce the exception copy link author julianhyde commented

that referenced this issue jan 2016 add failing test for 1083 loading status checks 12f copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2016 yes can reproduce this interesting enough this only occurs when default impl used explicit type gives trouble and related the only warning within code related construction java type for default impl this related refactoring type resolution system all all makes sense just for this case otherwise many other tests should failing could related one other problem fixed bit earlier related constructor simple type cowtowncoder changed the title field base class not recognized field base class not recognized when using json type default impl jan 2016 cowtowncoder closed this dbf jan 2016 cowtowncoder added this the milestone jan 2016 copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2016 somewhat ironic this was due one thing suspected could cause problems and did was able patch this pass for tested case and some others but file another issue for bigger fix that may need wait until but patch should work for common cases until then cowtowncoder mentioned this issue jan 2016 change type deserializer base take java type for default impl not class 1084 closed copy link author julianhyde commented jan 2016 glad was able help having just upgraded from perfectly happy with for now and looking forward trying yaml support the way thank you for producing excellent open source project jackson pleasure use copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2016 julianhyde thank you glad you have enjoyed using and also for the bug report aryehpro added commit aryehpro jackson databind that referenced this issue jan 2016 merge branch master https github com faster xml jackson databind 3520 tatu saloranta 113 and others via tatu saloranta master https github com faster xml jackson databind 124 commits minor addition related faster xml 1087 resolve context type assuming type bindings from that are expected work add unit test for faster xml 999 minor warnings cleanup add javadoc badge with automatic version detection fix faster xml 1083 add failing test for faster xml 1083 add unit test verify that object works via atomic reference too minor javadoc improvement wrt faster xml 1076 making simple type construct class deprecated was not yet for some reason should have been fix faster xml 1078 fix faster xml 1079 maven release plugin prepare for next development iteration maven release plugin prepare release jackson databind prepare for final fix faster xml 1073 try reproduce faster xml 1074 javadoc trimming try reproduce faster xml 825 again still passes minor improvement ensure base encoding uses configured setting undo part change done for string deserializer caused issues with xml handling further minor cleanups cleanup cowtowncoder mentioned this issue feb 2016 problem with polymorphic types losing properties from base type 1125 closed michalmela mentioned this issue apr 2018 improve handling json type info default impl anchor

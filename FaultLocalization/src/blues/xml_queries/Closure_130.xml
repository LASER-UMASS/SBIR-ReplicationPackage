<description>using  advanced  optimizations  with compiler options collapse properties extern types  true  script  used  broke  was  something  like  function  return  function  var  arg  arguments set timeout  function  alert  args  unfortunately  was  rewritten  function  return  function set timeout  function  alert  arguments  arguments  should  not  collapsed  can  you  provide  exact  snippet  not  able  reproduce  this  problem  also  note  that  code  that  you  provide  here  has  typo  arg  args compiler options collapse properties extern types  should  also  have  nothing  with  inlining  variables  yeah  almost  always  model  arguments  global  variable  that  can  change  over  time  there  was  bug  where  local  alias  arguments  was  getting  inlined  then  likely  that  bug  would  affect  all  global  variables  and  some  project  would  have  run  into  now  suspect  that  you  did  see  bug  but  that  you  mis  diagnosed  what  triggered  and  attempt  simplify  the  repro  steps  you  edited  out  the  trigger  added  example  this  behavior  the  following  repository  https  github  com  robbert  closure  compiler  tree  issue  931  the  following  commit  contains  one  build  with  and  one  without  the  flag  set  true  issue  931 query deferred  min  issue  931 query deferred  min collapse properties extern types  https  github  com  robbert  closure  compiler  commit 59bcf 89262c 76de 9ab 75599bdba 0291a 31cf  excerpt collapse properties extern types  true  function  var  return  function  console  log  this  were  arguments  originally  defined  var  new  this  then  function  var  console  log  this  ends  apply  arguments  instanceof  then  resolve  reject  instanceof  then  resolve  reject  resolve  return  return  new  without  that  flag  arguments  the  fifth  line  supposed  function  var  return  function  console  log  this  were  arguments  originally  defined  var  arguments  new  this  then  function  var  console  log  this  ends  apply  instanceof  then  resolve  reject  instanceof  then  resolve  reject  resolve  return  return  new  thank  you  for  the  detailed  reproduction  steps  was  able  reproduce  this  this  issue  was  closed  revision 9fac 3ccd 2fa</description>

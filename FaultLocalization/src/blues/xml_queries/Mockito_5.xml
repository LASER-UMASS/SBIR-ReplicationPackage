<summary>mockito  timeout  verification  needs  unit  classes verify error class def found error</summary>
<description>unit not the classpath and mockito version now and the code using the timeout verification which not supposed related unit then the jvm may fail with verify error class def found error this issue has been reported the mailing list and stack overflow simple test like that with test and unit the class path course exposes the issue import org testng annotations test import java util observable import static org mockito mockito public class verify error verification with timeout test test public void should not throw verify error verify mock observable class timeout 500 count

example user service impl test test user service impl test java test includes dependency unit which has the junit framework comparison failure but the jvm cannot perform the linking runtime verify error extends linkage error probably because for the jvm there some incompatible changes this class between version and note that mockito compiled against unit this also reveal that mockito not

added the bug label jan 2015 copy link member mockitoguy commented jan 2015 let change the code that unit not needed comparison failure should only used unit classpath that was the original idea but

since commit 2df 2df reply this email directly view git hub 152 comment szczepan faber core dev gradle founder mockito copy link contributor author bric commented jan 2015 need understand the change before removing copy link ferstl commented jan 2015 this also reveal that mockito not anymore compatible with unit should unit still supported yes the silent support unit exceptions handled the unit tool becomes more complicated due the different class hierarchy unit comparison failure more precisely would not possible anymore work with java lang assertion error for example verification over time impl would have work with java lang error some common error interface unit was supported another question the class org mockito exceptions verification junit arguments are different intended used clients the mockito library not suggest move right next the unit tool and reduce visibility default mockito should not have dependency unit this class must not used anywhere directly copy link contributor author bric commented jan 2015 ferstl you are correct the assignment the issue here for the unit compatibility yet wonder even care about unit nowaday especially with the upcoming mockito were api incompatibility somehow expected anyway implemented test that ensure that pure mockito api don have unit dependency the good news that only verification over time impl affected started fix branch yesterday for this issue where was thinking about the same kind tricks avoid future mess bric self assigned this jan 2015 copy link member mockitoguy commented jan 2015 want fix for

the build but doesn log the error fail violation fails violation and logs log violations console defaults true remove obsolete file 1010 fixed all the blocking and critical sonarcloud errors iluwatar 1020 1011 added suppress warnings for sonar cloud errors all these files are causing sonar cloud report the following error loops should not infinite since these instances all require infinite loop that will never end these warnings should disabled that sonar cloud longer reports them error the rule squid 2189 1011 made all the randoms static and final according sonar cloud rule random objects should reused randoms should not recreated this commit has taken all the randoms and made them constant variables the files that are using them add init update faq metadata 1010 fixed the two remaining sonar cloud errors iluwatar 1023 the two remaining files were still creating random everytime the method was called these were missed the previous commit because the previous commit had

<summary>cmaes optimizer  with  bounds  fits  finely  near  lower  bound  and  coarsely  near  upper  bound</summary>
<description>when  fitting  with  bounds  the  cmaesoptimizer  fits  finely  near  the  lower  bound  and  coarsely  near  the  upper  bound  this  because  internally  maps  the  fitted  parameter  range  into  the  interval  the  unit  least  precision  ulp  between  floating  point  numbers  much  smaller  near  zero  than  near  one  thus  fits  have  much  better  resolution  near  the  lower  bound  which  mapped  zero  than  the  upper  bound  which  mapped  one  will  attach  example  program  demonstrate</description>

<summary>json property  access  access  read  only  unexpected  behaviour</summary>
<description>hey was hoping make use json property access access read only but failed assume this class public class test pojo private string first name private string last name json property access access read only public string get full name return first name last name public string get first name return first name public void set first name string first name this first name first name public string get last name return last name public void set last name string last name this last name last name couldn find way stop the deserializer from attempting deserialize the field full name the only thing that helps create setter and annotate with json ignore however that setter does not make sense and don want have this bug behaviour missing something thanks the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered copy link member cowtowncoder commented sep 2015 that does sound like bug indeed which version are you using copy link member cowtowncoder commented sep 2015 whoa there unit test coverage for value read only that should not the case wonder there could bug lurking there copy link member cowtowncoder commented sep 2015 can reproduce this with looks like read only does actually hide remove setter method test fails with unknown property but will not mark ignorable which probably should cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this issue sep 2015 add failing test for 935 73b 072 copy link member cowtowncoder commented sep 2015 added failing test case for this but not sure how easy will pipe ignore information thank you for reporting the problem again copy link author weaselmetal commented sep 2015 thanks for dealing with the issue and sorry for the lack details description afaik access read only has just been added also got the unrecognized property exception unrecognized field full name not marked ignorable copy link member cowtowncoder commented sep 2015 correct only which why realized that asking for version wasn fully necessary but only after asking the fix would essentially carry along the name ignorable property similar how json ignore tracked but need see how that plumbing handled since discovery occurs bit different place copy link mewert commented feb 2016 there some easy workaround until this fixed mean instead implementing noop setter method the annotation json ignore properties sounds like could help here but also has effect add getter regardless which values choose for allow getters allow setters update seems that found solution adding json ignore properties value some field allow getters true allow setters false the class this could solution don need the json ignore properties annotation class level for other purposes copy link member cowtowncoder commented feb 2016 plattfish thank you for sharing this hoping address this along with some issues with creator property handling copy link thedoctor commented aug 2016 any movement here just bumped into this issue copy link heruan commented sep 2016 don know related but experiencing this with map public class ticket json property access access read only json serialize using map array serializer class public sorted map timer integer get service timers all works serialization but deserialization ticket get this exception can not find map key deserializer for type simple type class timer source java sequence input stream 1100946d line column com fasterxml jackson databind json mapping exception from json mapping exception java 261 jackson hexfaker mentioned this issue sep 2016 json property access read only unxepected behaviour with collections 1382 closed copy link jyothri commented nov 2016 also have come across this issue using spring boot which pulled jackson version copy link msfanous commented dec 2016 this disabling this feature your object mapper helped avoid this issue object mapper mapper new object mapper mapper disable mapper feature use getters setters copy link philbayer commented jan 2017 cowtowncoder any word fix for this using and appears the issue persists plattfish solution did not work for don mind trying isolate the issue myself will speed development patch cowtowncoder added active labels jan 2017 copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2017 philbayer activity this one have been slowly fixing similar bugs hope have another look this one thank you for the ping for some reason hadn tagged copy link member cowtowncoder commented jan 2017 heruan way related and when expectation that map not deserialized although msfanous suggestion also relevant cowtowncoder removed the active label jan 2017 cowtowncoder added this the milestone jan 2017 cowtowncoder added commit that referenced this issue jan 2017 fix 935 loading status checks 34006 cowtowncoder closed this jan 2017 mduesterhoeft pushed commit mduesterhoeft spring data rest that referenced this issue feb 2017 fixed with skipping ignored properties 85c only working with jackson snapshot see faster xml jackson databind 935 mduesterhoeft pushed commit mduesterhoeft spring data rest that referenced this issue feb 2017 skip all ignored json properties 2dfff avoid accidentally set them null revert fixed with skipping ignored properties this reverts commit 85c fixed with skipping ignored properties only working with jackson snapshot see faster xml jackson databind 935 reproduce datarest 1006 copy link jyothri commented mar 2017 cowtowncoder pulled for jackson databind but unable deserialize json property access access write only private string password plaintext only remove the access modifier able deserialize the json properly however not want involve this serialization this fixed this same issue copy link member cowtowncoder commented mar 2017 jyothri there are remaining problems please file new issue with reproduction possible that fix incomplete something your setup differs significantly don know without reproduction copy link yash arya wisc commented aug 2017 edited has this been fixed still seem seeing this issue edit plattfish workaround works for copy link member cowtowncoder commented aug 2017 yash arya please read previous comment fixed the best knowledge for remaining problems any please file new issue with reproduction showing what not working wwwcomy mentioned this issue oct 2017 json property access read only not work 1805 closed copy link angor stv commented mar 2018 agree this does not work until now json property access json property access read only public boolean enriched return enriched payload null and have when deserialise unrecognized field enriched class transaction not marked ignorable use spring boot copy link member cowtowncoder commented mar 2018 angor stv please not keep adding comments closed issues really not care for one files new case with reproduction reproduction must not rely frameworks like spring boot copy link iuliana commented aug 2019 neither json property access json property access write only field json ignore properties value password allow setters true work for just cannot set the value during deserialization maybe you should consider reopening this copy link jwgmeligmeyling commented aug 2019 try read only think the annotations are from the frameworks perspective not the client copy link member cowtowncoder commented aug 2019 edited jwgmeligmeyling correct naming not intuitive originally hoped incorrect explanation removed copy link iuliana commented aug 2019 thank you but damn the documentation this confusing access setting that means that the property may only written set for deserialization but will not read get serialization that the value the property not included serialization write only says that property may only written set for deserialization which what needed copy link iuliana commented aug 2019 read only doesn either this setup with spring boot sample the proof directory there are screenshots with execution paused while person manager application tests test post copy link member cowtowncoder commented aug 2019 iuliana can you please file new issue with the link don usually open issues cases where there has been previous fix that will make release notes more difficult follow will try improve javadocs wrt setting well copy link member cowtowncoder commented aug 2019 also earlier explanation was exactly backwards javadocs state correctly not well read only refers pojo being handled read only way and write only opposite java centric not json centric really should have named values differently getter only setter only perhaps copy link 3rm commented jul 2020 edited cowtowncoder think this still not fixed have the same problem with getter annotated with json property value access json property access read only the bean deserializer base tries deserialize

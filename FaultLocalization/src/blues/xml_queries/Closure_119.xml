<summary>catch  yields  jsc  undefined  name  warning  when  used  catch  advanced  mode</summary>
<description>what  steps  will  reproduce  the  problem  set  closure  for  advanced  compilation  compile  this closure compiler  compilation  level  advanced  optimizations  output  file  name  default closure compiler  try  var  catch  var  quot  fail  quot  name  quot  quot  message  what  the  expected  output  what  you  see  instead  expect  warning  error  for  this  instead  see  this  jsc  unreachable  code  unreachable  code  line  character  catch  jsc  undefined  name  never  defined  line  character  var  quot  fail  quot  name  quot  quot  message  jsc  undefined  name  never  defined  line  character  var  quot  fail  quot  name  quot  quot  message  case  especially  complaining  about  the  jsc  undefined  name  warning  also  seems  the  unreachable  complaint  isn  right  but  not  sure  what  version  the  product  are  you  using  what  operating  system  using  this  url  http  closure  compiler  appspot  com  home  using  chrome  browser  windows  version  1500  but  this  server  side  error  from  what  see  please  provide  any  additional  information  below  yeah  unfortunately  the  compiler  doesn  model  correctly  variables  introduced  catch  block  currently  the  process  rewriting  the  type  inference  algorithm  and  will  fix  this  the  new  algorithm  but  not  going  ready  for  couple  more  months  dimvar  think  you  misreading  the  error  much  simpler  than  that  posted  fix  here  http  codereview  appspot  com  12744050  jeffreygreenberg  the  unreachable  warning  correct  because  var  can  throw  error  this  issue  was  closed  revision 046e 226e  this  issue  was  closed  revision 046e 226e  that  can  correct  the  catch  can  never  occur  this  simplified  code  and  the  point  catch  error  should  programming  error  may  correct  now  but  the  future  might  screw  the  code  semantically  correct  and  hence  the  compiler  should  allow  not  reject  hope  you  closed  because  you  fixed  not  because  you  saying  unreachable  warning  correct  feel  free  make  the  line  var  instead  call  function  which  will  throw  error  that  would  semantically  equivalent  the  case  you  are  ignoring  nick  mentioned  the  jsc  unreachable  code  correct  because  the  compiler  knows  that  var  can  never  through  error  more  complex  code  can  throw  error  and  does  not  produce  that  warning  take  the  following  example closure compiler  compilation  level  advanced  optimizations  output  file  name  default closure compiler  try  any  the  following  compile  without  warning  throw  new  error  custom  error  document get element does not exist inner html  foo  window external function  catch  var  fail  name  message  this  issue  was  closed  revision 046e 226e</description>

<summary>change  behavior  with  with  content</summary>
<description>edited looks like read tree methods object mapper object reader that take input other than json parser and are given empty input only white space available before end will return null node jackson and including return null jackson latter behavior what read tree json parser has and will but this accidentally changed other methods due refactoring that unified underlying call handling and add checking for new deserialization feature fail trailing tokens behavior for this edge case was not being tested apparently now since behavior has been changed for all patch versions not sure should changed for branch but seems sub optimal behavior and something definitely change for but probably also for there are multiple things could change back return null node change throw exception not valid use case change return missing node leave for rest although might seem best revert that seems somewhat wrong problematic would now not possible distinguish between json null value and missing content and although would probably make sense designing api from scratch probably too intrusive think the best way avoids returning null throwing exception both being likely break code but still allows distinguishing between all possible input cases the text was updated successfully but these errors were encountered cowtowncoder added active labels dec 2018 cowtowncoder changed the

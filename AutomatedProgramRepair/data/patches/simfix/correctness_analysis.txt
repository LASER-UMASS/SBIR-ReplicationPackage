================
chart1_0.diff,			exact match
closure126_0.diff,		semantically equivalent, since n.isTry() is true the if-statement added will be true because n.isName() will be false effectively deleting the code deleted by developer 
closure14_0.diff,		exact match
closure161_0.diff,		exact match
closure57_0.diff,		exact match
closure62_0.diff,		exact match
closure68_0.diff,		exact match
closure73_0.diff,		exact match
closure92_0.diff,		exact match
compress27_0.diff,		semantically equivalent, patch returns 0L and prevents throwing exception by adding if statement that is true when start == end
csv15_0.diff,			semanticall equivalent, the if condition deleted by developer is replaced by simfix with a condition that will lead to correct behavior 
gson15_0.diff,			exact match
jacksondatabind54_0.diff,	semantically equivalent, patch adds the statement declaredType=actualType
jacksondatabind83_0.diff,	semantically equivalent, modified if condition will always be true (same as deleting if condition in developer patch)

# Available and Reusuable Badges

We are applying for the *available* and *reusable* artifact badges. 
We believe our artifact deserves the available badge because we make 
available all the materials used to implement and replicate our study, 
including the artifacts of existing fault localization and program repair
tools used for running experiments and evaluation. 

We also make available the source code for:
1. SBFL implemented using latest version of GZoltar (v1.7.2) and Ochiai ranking strategy. 
2. Blues, our statement-level IR-based fault localization technique that localizes defects using bug reports. 
3. RAFL, an unspervised technique to combine multiple fault location techniques. 
4. SBIR, an instance of RAFL that combines SBFL and Blues using Cross-Entropy Monte Carlo algorithm and Spearman footrule distance.
5. Scripts to setup, execute, and evaluate all the experiments related to fault localization and program repair.   

We believe our artifact deserves the reusable badge because the materials we make available 
in our artifact can be reused by researchers and practitioners in various ways -- either 
to replicate our study on different defect benchmarks or to augment or improve their own 
studies and technologies.
